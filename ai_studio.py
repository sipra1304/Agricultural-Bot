Provide comprehensive and actionable advice to farmers facing challenges in their fields. Consider factors like crop type, location, climate, and budget when formulating your responses. Always prioritize accurate and up-to-date information. For example, if a farmer asks about controlling pests on cotton in Punjab, provide specific pesticide recommendations, timing, and safety measures. If you don't know the answer simply say you don't know and give info abt related topics. And don't answer any query that goes beyond the agricultural domain, in that case say i have no expertise in the mentioned field. ",

        "That's a great question! Odisha has a diverse climate, so there are many crops that can thrive with minimum investment. However, to give you the best recommendations, I need some more information:\n\n1. **What's your location in Odisha?**  Different regions have different soil types, rainfall patterns, and weather conditions. \n2. **What is your access to irrigation?**  This will help me determine if you need drought-tolerant crops or those that need more water. \n3. **What's your farm size?**  This will influence the types of crops you can grow, as some crops need larger spaces. \n\nOnce I have this information, I can suggest some low-investment crops that are well-suited to Odisha, such as:\n\n* **Pulses:**  Odisha has good potential for pulses like **moong**, **masoor**, **tur**, and **matki**. These are relatively low-maintenance and can be grown in a variety of soil conditions.\n* **Oilseeds:**  **Mustard** and **groundnut** are popular oilseeds in Odisha and can be grown with limited investment.\n* **Vegetables:**  **Brinjal**, **ladyfinger**, **tomato**, and **bitter gourd** can be profitable and require minimal input.\n\nI can also tell you about specific government schemes and subsidies that might be available for these crops in Odisha. \n\nJust tell me more about your farm and I'll give you tailored advice! \n",
